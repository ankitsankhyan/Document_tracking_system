# Doctrak - Document Tracking System

Doctrak is a document tracking system that allows users to create and track the current status of documents. It utilizes Node.js, RSA for digital signature, Redis for caching, and Node.js cluster for multicore utilization, ensuring efficient performance and secure document handling. Users can create documents and track their progress as they move through various stages and are handled by designated dispatchers and responsible authorities.

## Features

1. **Document Creation**: Users can create new documents within the system.

2. **Digital Signature**: Node RSA is used to apply digital signatures to documents, ensuring data integrity and authentication.

3. **Document Tracking**: The system allows users to track the current status of documents as they progress through different stages.

4. **Dispatcher Handling**: When a document is created, a dispatcher is tagged to handle its routing to the responsible authority.

5. **Multiple Dispatcher Handling**: The system efficiently handles scenarios where multiple dispatchers are available. Requests are distributed among them, and the first dispatcher to select a request takes responsibility for handling it.

6. **Authority Tagging**: The responsible authority is tagged to each document, and they can digitally sign the document using their provided private key.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ankitsankhyan/Document_tracking_system.git
   cd doctrak
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Redis**:

   Ensure that Redis is installed and running on your system. If not, download and install it from [Redis Website](https://redis.io/download).

4. **Set Environment Variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set the following variables:

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
   REDIS_PORT=6379
   REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password
   ```

5. **Generate RSA Key Pair**:

   For each user RSA key pair is generated when user want but only once. Public key is stored inside the database and private key is given to each user which gets download in form of .txt file. To sign the doc user has to upload that file there
6. **Start the Application**:

   Start the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

7. **Usage**:

   The application will now be running at `http://localhost:8000`. Users can interact with the system through API endpoints.
Certainly! Let's merge the additional API endpoints for UserRoutes with the previously compiled list of endpoints:
